# z80e-cx2
Port of the z80e Ti-73/83+/SE/84+/SE/CSE emulator that was made by the KnightOS team.

## Compiling

First make sure you have [scas](https://github.com/KnightOS/scas) installed with
libscas built for the nspire (using nspire-gcc).

Native (Linux):

    $ make
No more CMake as it was not a build system I appreciate, I prefer directly working with GNU make.

## Help, Bugs, Feedback

Dont hesitate to report bugs in an issue, and contribute suing PRs. any help in porting this emulator to other Ti-nspire models is welcome.
